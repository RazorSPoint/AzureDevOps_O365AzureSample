# DevOps Best Practices Sample for Azure & O365

This project has started as a learning project for me (Sebastian Sch√ºtze) to find a DevOps best practices example, which can be tried out and used for showing in presentations. The goal is to have a practical example that could exist in the real world. 

This example does not have the goal to be perfect, since it should include incomplete to look like it could be a working but not yet finished project.
